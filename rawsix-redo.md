# The Basics

Raw Six is an experiment to create a light, very simple implementation of the Open D6 game system. It is designed to "get out of the way" of play at the table and allow the narrative story to continue without interruption.

## Conventions

- Raw Six uses only regular six-sided dice, with each player needing about 5 or 6 with one of a different colour or size to represent the "Wild Die".
- For ease of management, Raw Six use the following convention when noting numbers - XD+Y. Where X represents how many dice (D) are rolled, and Y notes if anything additional (pips) should be added to the total rolled on the dice.

  For instance, 3D+2 means that three dice are rolled and added together, and then two more is added to that total.

- The Wild Die "explodes" when a 6 rolled. Not only does this add 6 to the total but it can be rolled and added again. A Wild Die continues to explode until no further 6s are rolled!

## Rolling dice

The following process outlines the basic mechanics of all dice rolling in Raw Six.

### Completing a task

1. Determine Difficulty: The Game Master picks which attribute the activity falls under and its Difficulty. To succeed the player must roll a total equal or higher than the target number.
   - This target number can either be a set number (as noted in the Target Difficulties section) or a number noted on an opponent's character sheet (such as their defence or resistance to wounds).
2. Build a Dice Pool. A dice pool is made up of a number of dice equal to the appropriate Attributes plus:
   - An additional die for each applicable [Tag](#tags) the character has.
   - An additional for each point of [Stress](#stress-points) the play which to gain.
   - Any bonuses from [Equipment](#equipment--gear).
   - An additional die for each other character supporting the task attempt.
3. Identify the Wild Die, one of the dice in the pool is assigned the "Wild Die" (and is usually a different colour from the rest for ease of identification).
4. Roll the Dice. The Dice Pool is rolled, and the total of all dice are added together (remembering the Wild Die explodes).
5. Determine Success. Compare the total rolled versus the Target Number. If this total equal or exceed the Target Number, then the task is a success. If not, the Task is a failure.

## Task difficulties

As noted above the total needed to succeed on a roll is set as a Difficulty. In most circumstances this is a set number (as noted in the table below), although for some tasks this can be based on a characters (or non-player character's) [Defences](#static-defences).

| Difficulty | Target Number |
| ---------- | ------------- |
| Simple     | 7             |
| Average    | 9             |
| Hard       | 11            |
| Very Hard  | 13            |
| Formidable | 15            |

## Example of Raw Six tasks mechanics

The following is an example of how the core dice rolling mechanics works when attempting tasks in Raw Six:

*Jon's character Heldaw needs to attempt to climb a wall to sneak into a bandit's castle. The Game Master determines that this is a **Hard** task to complete, which requires that Jon rolls 11 or more on his Task roll and will utilise Physique as the Attribute (in which Heldaw has 2D+2).*

*To build his Dice Pool, Jon, grabs 2D (his Physique attribute dice) and puts to the GM that Heldaw should add a die for his Tag "Tough". The GM disagrees however, and so instead Heldaw burns a Stress point (representing him putting extra kevels of concentration and effort into the task) to gain an extra die, giving him a total of 3D+2.*

*Jon then decides that his red die (the others are green) will be his Wild Die and rolls all the dice together. This results in the numbers, 1, 2 and 6 (on the Wild Die) coming up. Adding these three together and adding the plus two, Jon can see he has the 11 required (1+2+6+2) to succeed in the task.*

*However, for fun, as the Wild Die came up a 6, Jon rolls it again getting a 5. This means that Jon rolled a final total of 16, much more than was needed. As a result, with barely a grunt, Heldaw scales the walls of the keep, and is soon in the confines of the fortâ€¦*

# Creating character

Every player has a character. All characters are defined with the four aspects: Attributes, Tags, Perks and Complications. To differentiate the Player Characters from the individuals and opponents they will encounter in play, they also have Fate Points and a Stress Pool.

To create a character the player should complete the following steps.

1. Distribute 15D between their six Attributes.
2. For each Attribute select a number of Tags.
3. Select a character Perk
4. Determine a character's Complications.
5. Note the character's Defences, Stress Threshold
   and Fate.
6. Select any equipment.

## Attributes

Each Character has five attributes which measure the basic physical and mental abilities that are common to every creature. Characters distribute 15 Attribute Dice among these attributes. These are normally rated on a scale of 1D to 4D, although some factors may changethis range.

- **Physique** represents physical strength and toughness.
- **Co-ordination** represents aim and manual dexterity
- **Agility** represents speed and responsiveness.
- **Wit** represents mental creativity and intelligence.
- **Charm** represents charisma, presence and natural leadership ability.
- **Will** represents mental resolve, and mental fortitude.

Attribute dice may be split into "pips", with each die is equal to three pips. An Attribute may have dice only (no bonus pips), +1 or +2. Going to "+3" advances the die code to the next largest die.

## Tags

Tags represent the unique skills, knowledge, and training of the character. The Player should:

- Select 1 Tag for each of their Attributes. The only exception being if they only have 1D (with or
  without pips) assigned, in which case that Attribute does not get a Tag.
- Select an additional second Tag for their single highest Attribute.

Tags should be single word descriptive words that reflect the characters abilities, skills, nowledge, or background.

The usefulness of Tags is usually determined by the setting in which the session is being played (for example creating a Tag called "Astronaut" might be redundant in a traditional fantasy game setting).

While no limiters are placed one what can be used as a Tag, general advice is that they fall under a one of the following categories.

- **A Knowledge or Education**: A training or set of skills a character might have acquired prior to play. This could be generic - doctor, mechanic, pilot - but could also be more specific such as Professor of Anthropology, 2008 Winner of Mastermind UK.
- **A Unique Ability**: Something that the character has naturally manifested. This could be some physical or mental trait - Eagled Eyed, Fitness Freak, Brawler - or something more esoteric - Spell Caster, Sixth Sense, Disarming Voice.

Players should work with the Game Master to determine their final Tags.

### Example tags

The following provides a few example Tags and how they might be used during play. For each two alternate names or activities is noted, although it is reasonable to think that each would allow and limit

- **Mechanic/Engineer**: The character is trained as mechanic. They invoke this Tag; when building or repairing engines or machines, attempting to understand how a device works, or talking about technology, etc.
- **Singing Voice/Actor**: The character has the voice of an angel. They invoke this Tag; when involved in performing arts, to assist in convincing others, or discussing music.
- **Endurance/Outdoorsman**: The character has impressive stamina. This can be invoked when attempting to survive in harsh conditions, or is undertaking periods of physical stress - such as running, going a long time without sleep, etc.
- **Marksman/Soldier**: The character is a crack shot. They invoke this Tag to; increase their Dice Pool in a ranged conflict task, understand weaponry or even work out the best location to ambush a target.
- **Observant/Scout**: The character is keen eyed and alert. This Tag can be invoked to gain when making awareness rolls, or recalling a specific event or activity

## Perks & complications

Perks are benefits innate to the character. This could represent their race in the setting, special skill, or talent. Each character has 1 free Perk to select. Perks should bend the core mechanics without breaking them (i.e. might provide the character with an additional Fate Point, or allow them to act as if one of their Static Defences is one D higher, etc.)

Complications represent the hindrances or difficulties in the character's life. A character may choose up to 2 Complications during character creation, these represent limitations or restrictions on the character and are used as a roleplaying aid. When a character acts based on their complication or are compelled to by the Game Master, they receive a temporary Fate Point.

### Example perks

The following provides some generic Perks players might want to assign to their characters. Often a setting will provide a selection of Perks used to reflect the style of game play in that world.

- **Bag of Junk**: Over the months you've collected a variety of odds and ends in a carryall. For the cost of one (1) Fate you can find something important within.
- **Martial Artist**: You have trained as a martial artist and known how to defend yourself. Gain +1D for melee damage and +3 Block.
- **Combat Reflexes**: You are always alert and ready for action. You don't need to roll for Initiative in the first round of any conflict; you always go first. In subsequent rounds you gain +1D to Wits when rolling for Initiative.
- **Lucky**: To date you've led a charmed life, although you never know how long this is going to last. You start each game session with one (1) more Fate.

### Example complications

Similarly, below is listed a number of sample complications players can use as examples to create their own.

- **Age**: You are either every young or elderly and as such many people often ignore you. If you decide that this contributes to a scene, regain one (1) Fate.
- **Sense of Honour**: Despite your desire to not get involved in other people's problems, you often struggle to look away in the face of injustice. If you decide that this contributes to a scene, regain one (1) Fate.
- **Weak Willed**: For whatever reason you find yourself falling in line with others even when you know you should make up your own mind! If you decide that this contributes to a scene, regain one (1) Fate.
- **Kleptomaniac**: You don't know why, but "things" of all sorts seem attracted to you. Of course taking other people's things without asking often gets you in hot water. If you decide that this contributes to a scene, regain one (1) Fate.

## Static defences

Each character has three static defence numbers:

- **Block** represents the character's ability to defend themselves in melee. This is calculated by multiplying their **Co-ordination** by 2 and adding any pips.
- **Dodge** represents their ability to avoid ranged or melee attacks. This is calculated by multiplying their **Agility** D by 3 and adding any pips.
- **Toughness** represents how resilient they are to wounds. This is calculated by multiplying their **Physique** by 3 and adding any pips.
- **Mental Fortitude** represents how resistant the character is to otherworldly or psychological effects. This is calculated by multiplying their **Will** by 3 and adding any pips.

## Stress threshold

Stress represents mental damage taken by the character either through encounters or their actions. The character's Stress Threshold is equal to their **Will** plus **Physique** dice (ignoring any pips) expressed as a number.

Additionally, Stress can be gained to allocate additional dice (at a rate of 1D per point of Stress) when attempting a Task. Note that characters taking enough Stress to reach their Stress Threshold may be seriously impaired.

## Fate points

Each character starts each game session with 3 Fate Points. These are used to represent the special nature of player characters. Fate points can be used to:

- Reroll any number of dice non-Wild Dice in a task
- Remove one (1) level of Wounds immediately after it is taken
- Remove three (3) stress points after a short rest.

Fate can be gained by:

- Invoking a Complication
- As the result of good roleplaying

## Equipment & gear

Equipment comes in a number of forms. In general, it either:

- Allows a character to undertake an action (i.e. lock picks to unlock a door). In this case, the task could not be attempted if the gear wasn't available.
- Provides a benefit to the character in their task (i.e. undertaking an operation in a well-equipped surgery). Generally, this will provide an additional Die (or 2) to the character when they attempt the task at hand.
- Provides specific statistics or mechanics that detail a particular rule in the game. For example, weapons are used to define damage and effects of hitting with a weapon, while armour increases a character's Toughness.

### Weapons & armour

All weapons and armour have a number of details and statistics that that used to determine how they function and how effective they are (see [Sample weapons & armour](#sample-weapons--armour)).

The following table summarises how these specific
rules for weapons and armour is utilised.

| Statistic          | Description                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Damage             | This is the number of Base Damage dice rolled on a successful hit to calculate the weapons effect.                                                                                |
| Penetration (Pen)  | The effectiveness of the weapon against armour. The target's Armour Rating (AV) - if they are wearing any - is reduced by this number when successfully hit.                      |
| Range              | Range in Yards before the Range modifier is applied. A weapon can effectively fire 4 times this range, but for each range step the Range modifier is applied.                     |
| Armour Rating (AV) | The effectiveness of the armour. This isadded to the characters base Toughness.                                                                                                   |
| Era                | A note on what period the weapon or armour comes from. All armour has its armour rating (AV) halved (round down) vs weapons from a later era (i.e. verse a pistol Plate is AV 1). |
| Notes              | Any additional information or special rules for the weapon or armour.                                                                                                             |

## Playing a character again

Although Raw Six was designed for one-off play, characters might find their adventures continued at some later date. While there is no experience system, characters successfully completing a quest or mission, or simply surviving a scenario relatively intact may choose one of the following rewards:

- **Gain a New Tag**: This Tag should reflect the experience the character gained on their adventure.
- **Gain +1 Pip to any Attribute**: Characters get stronger, faster and wiser as time passes. As with Pips allocated during character generation going to "+3" Pips advances the die code to the next largest die.

# Powers & Abilities

In various settings characters can display powers of one sort of another. These might represent arcane magic, superpowers or even special one-off abilities provided by a Perk or to a specific species within the game world.

How characters gain access to powers depends on the setting and style of game being played but will usually require the acquisition of a specific Perk.

## Stress Points

To manifest powers or abilities characters Raw Six use Stress. This represents everything from the effort to memorised arcane magic, the raw willpower to manipulate reality through to energy needed to invest a device to activate it.

In some setting characters might have access to pools additional Stress points or ways of generating Stress points specifically for manifesting powers.

### Activating the power

In most cases, it costs 1 Stress to trigger an ability, and will usually require the Task roll to successfully achieve its effects. Some powers can be enhanced or extended for the cost of extra Stress.

### Regaining stress used for powers

As with the expenditure of Stress in all other cases ([taking stress](#taking-stress) or [getting wounded](#injuries-table), etc) recovery of Stress used for powers is at the discretion of the Game Master, but usually regenerate after a refreshing rest is completed. This might represent the character getting an hour's sleep, or reflect a sorcerer spending his time memorising his spell book.

## Aquiring powers

Again the list of powers or abilities a character might have depends greatly on the setting in which they are playing. A Wizard or Cleric might have access to a number of "spells", while a future-world might only have one or two.

## Using a power or ability

An ability is usually requires a Task roll based on the powers" **Controlling Attribute** to be activated.

## "Always on" abilities

Some abilities may be deemed to be "always on" (such as
a superhero with the ability to fly for example). For each "always on" a character has their Power Point pool is permanently reduced by 1.

For example, Thomas' Post-Apocalypse Mutant character has 3 Power Points (equal to his Will Attribute), and as one of his powers decides to take the Telepathy ability. As this ability is deemed to be "always on" it costs 1 permanent Power Point, which reduces his Power Point Pool for his other abilities.

## Example power task modifiers

These may be modified by various situational circumstances or events.

| Situation             | Modifier                  | Description                                                                                                     |
| --------------------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| No Pressure Situation | +1D                       | Activating a power when there is no time or situation pressures.                                                |

| Wounds                | As per the Injuries chart | Injuries may impair a character's competency to use an ability correctly.                                       |
| Targeting an Ability  | -1D per ally              | Targeting an ability into melee is difficult, especially when allies might be affected by an ability's outcome. |

# Mechanics

The following expands on the base process detailed
in the **Completing a Task** on page 2.

## Modifiers

There are various circumstances that may modify the number of dice a character or Non-Player Character might roll.

### Scaling

To reflect a difference in size, when targeting:

- larger targets, the attacker adds +1D to their Attribute for each scale size difference.
- smaller targets, the defender may add +1 to their Dodge Static Statistic for each scale size difference.

### Ranges

Range in Raw Six is generally abstract with an object or target said to be at one of the five ranges steps from the character (Melee, Short, Medium, Long, Extreme).

- Melee weapons can only be used in Melee range step.
- Range weapons can fire at any range but incur a -1D modifier for each range step beyond that listed on the weapon.

### Situational modifiers

The following modifiers reflect an increase or decrease in the character's chance of success in a task.

| Type                    | Modifier                                               |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Ganging-up          | +1D for each ally currently attacking an nemy in melee |
| Aiming              | +2D per action spent aiming at a target                |
| Wounded             | See [Wounding a Target](#wounding-a-target).           |
| Cover               | -1D to -5D depending on the type and impact of cover.  |
| Called Shot         | -1D to -5D depending on the size of the target.        |
| Unsuspecting Target | +3D to strike at a target not suspecting an attack.    |

### Critical failures

Critical failures occur when, in a task roll, more than half the dice in the Dice Pool roll a "1". I.e. if 2 or 3 dice are in the Dice Pool, 2 roll "1s". When 4 are in the Dice pool 3 must roll 1s.

If a critical failure occurs the worst possible outcome of the task is applied.

### Exceptional Success

If the total rolled ever exceeds the Target number of the task by 10 or more, an exceptional success occurs.

In this event, the player may immediately select one of the following bonuses:

- Recover 1 point of Stress
- Add 1D to the damage of the weapon used in the task roll.
- Move to the top of the Initiative order in the next round.
- Gain some non-mechanic bonus at the Game Master's discretion.

### Invoking tags

Tags are how Raw Six represents an individual's skills, talents, and worldly experience. Tags can be invoked any time a Task is attempted and, if appropriate, multiple Tags can be used in a Dice Pool.

Each Tag adds 1D the character's Dice Pool, with the Game Master as the final arbiter on when Tag can be invoked.

## Resolving conflict

In a conflict situation, the action is played out over a number of rounds. These rounds continue until the conflict is resolved.

### Order of conflict

Each Round the following steps are completed.

1. **Determine initiative**: Each character rolls their Initiative for the round.
2. **Declare**: In reverse order (from lowest to highest initiative), each character declares their actions for the round.
3. **Act**: In the order of Initiative, the character act out their actions.
4. **Recover**: As required, the players and Game Master complete any "house-keeping" of statistics, effects, or other mechanics.

### Initiative

At the beginning of each Round of combat, the combatants determine the order by rolling their **Wit** Dice and totalling the number rolled. In the case that to characters tie in Initiative, a D6 should be rolled to
determine who goes first.

Once the initiative order is determined each round of the conflict is divided into three phases.

## Actions

There isn't any set timeframe or limit to what a character can do in a Round. The Game Master remains the final arbiter of any actions. Some specific actions are detailed below.

### Non-combat actions

Conflict isn't only about shoot and hitting each other, and characters may want to do one of the following instead of attacking.

- **Assist**: The character spends their action helping their fellows by pointing out enemies and weak spots or assisting with reloading weapons, etc. Each assisting character provides a +1D to all allies" dice pools until they next act.
- **Assess**: Spending an action looking down a scope at an enemy (as per the **Situational Modifier: Aiming**) or sizing up an opponent provide +2D on the next action against the target.
- **Full Defence**: Doing nothing else but actively dodging as an action they gain +10 to their Dodge until their next action.

## Melee Combat

The action of striking at an opponent with a hand or close combat weapon.

1. The attacking character selects a target that is within Melee range.
2. The attacking character makes a **Physique** task roll versus using the defending character's Block Defence or Dodge Defence as the Target Number (the defender may choose which to use).
3. If the roll equals or exceed the selected defence, then the defender is hit (see [Wounding a Target](#wounding-a-target)).
4. If defender opted to Dodge and the roll is less than that defence then the attack misses.
5. If defender opted to Block and the roll is less than that defence then the attack misses, **and** the defender gets a free melee attack back versus the attacker's Block defence.

### Ranged Combat

The action of shooting or throwing a weapon.

1. The attacking character selects a target and checks its range.
2. The attacking character makes a **Co-ordination** task roll using the defending character's Dodge Defence as the Target Number.
3. If the roll equals or exceed their Dodge, then the defender is hit (see [Wounding a Target](#wounding-a-target)).

### Wounding a target

When him the attacker must determine the extent to the injury.

1. The attacking character rolls the damage for the weapon they have successful hit with. For ranged weapon, this is a set number of D, while for melee weapons this is equal to the character's **Physique** attribute plus additional D.
2. Compare the total rolled for damage versus the defenders' **Toughness** and consult the injuries table.

#### Injuries table

This table details the effects of injuries. If a character takes the same injury twice, the effect moves up one
level of effect.

| Difference | Effects                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0 or less  | No effect, the target is unharmed                                                                                                                                                            |
| 1-3        | *Stunned*: Either take 1 Stress Point or -1D on the next action the character attempts.                                                                                                      |
| 4-8        | *Wounded*: -1D to all actions until healed. If a second wound is taken the character becomes Severely Wounded: -2D on all actions until healed.                                              |
| 9-12       | *Critically Wounded*: The character barely remains in the fight. -2D on all actions until healed, but every turn the character must make a Simple **Physique** test or become incapacitated. |
| 13-15      | *Mortally Wounded*: The force of the attack renders the character unconscious and near death. The character make a Simple **Physique** test each turn or die.                                |
| 16+        | *Dead*: The character has perished. The Game Master may allow a First Aid roll to save the character.                                                                                        |

## Taking stress

A character accumulating enough Stress to reach their Stress Threshold, they are immediately rendered unconscious (unless the event pushing them over the Threshold states differently.

Characters can take Stress voluntarily or as the result of an event or encounter. This includes:

- To add addition dice when attempting a Task.
- As the result of Wounds (i.e. when a Stun or special effect impacts the character), or
- When affected by a psychological effect as the result of fear, chemicals, or encountering otherworldly horrors.

### Resisting psychological effects

Character use their *Mental Fortitude* to resist the effects of any psychological attack. Each effect, monster or event will utilise specific Attributes to roll against this defence.

Additionally any attack rolling higher than the character's *Mental Fortitude* will inflicts Wounds, Stress or other effects as individually noted.

### Reaching your stress threshold

If a character takes enough stress to reach their Stress Threshold, they are immediately render incapacitated and take one level of injury.

## Healing

As time passes, character heal from their wounds and recover from Stress.

### First aid

Characters can attempt to immediately heal a character one level of injury. This is done as **Wit** task with the following difficulty.

| Injury Target      | Number |
| ------------------ | ------ |
| Wounded            | 7      |
| Severely Wounded   | 9      |
| Critically Wounded | 11     |
| Mortally Wounded   | 13     |
| Dead               | 15     |

Only one level of injury can be healed by First Aid
each day.

### Naturally healing wounds

If a wounded character rests he is allowed a **Physique** test and if successful heals an injury level. The frequency of the check depends on the severity of the character's wounds.

| Injury             | Frequency | Target Number |
| ------------------ | --------- | ------------- |
| Wounded            | 1 Day     | 7             |
| Severely Wounded   | 3 Days    | 7             |
| Critically Wounded | 1 Week    | 9             |
| Mortally Wounded   | 3 Weeks   | 11            |

### Recovering stress

Stress can be recovered in a number of ways:

- As an option as the result of an [Exceptional success](#exceptional-success).
- As a reward for an outstanding action or milestone situation.
- After a full and restful night's sleep (or similar) period of recovery.

The amount of Stress recovered depends on the circumstance of the rest and can range rom one to three points.

## Example of conflict

The following is an example of how a round of conflict can occur in Raw Six:

*Jon's character Heldaw has snuck into an enemy castle and is making his way to the bandit chief's sleeping quarters. Turning a corner he runs straight into one very awake guard, who drawing his blade, challenges the intruder. Never one to parley when a good fight is in the offing, Jon states that Heldaw attacks the guardsman!*

*As it is the beginning of a round, both sides roll their Initiative rolls. The Guard has 2D+1 for his Wits, while Heldaw has 3D. Unfortunately for Jon he rolls only 6 on his dice, while the Game Master rolls 11.*

*The players then declare their character's actions, and given that Jon lost this rounds initiative, he must declare first. Thinking on it for a moment, he states that Heldaw will attempt to strike the guard down, while the Game Master says that his guard will also attack the intruder. As these actions resolve themselves in a pretty straight
forward manner, the Game Master and Jon agree just to move into the Act phase of the ound.*

*The Guard attacks first and determines their dice pool to be 3D+1 (the NPCs Physique dice of 2D+1 and adding +1D for the Guardsman Tag). The Game Master rolls the dice and gets a total of 15. As Heldaw's Dodge Defence is only 11, the adventurer is hit*

# Non-player character

For the most part Non-Player Characters of all types (friends, enemies, allies, or opponents) can be treated the same as the Characters. They will have Attributes, Tags and Equipment. They should not have access however to Fate or Stress points (these should remain unique to the Player Characters). When conflict occurs, however, the Game Master needs a simple way of tracking the effects and injuries inflicted on these individuals.

## NPC damage & wounds

Rather than using the Injuries table most NPCs/Creatures damage have a number of Wounds
they can take and a number of Scratches they can absorb.

- **Scratches**: This represents a level of toughness the creature has before it starts to take any wounds. The number of Scratches an opponent can take varies, with minor NPCs have likely having none, and Dragons or Giants having many.
- **Wounds**: Most regular NPCs can only take one Wound before being incapacitated (such as
  Goblins or normal humans etc.), but some might be able to multiple before they are out of a fight.
- **Wound Thresholds**: For NPCs with multiple wounds this is the number they can take before have some mechanic effect on their dice pools (as occurs with Character Injuries).

### NPC damage table

When an NPC or creature is hit use the following table instead (rather than the injuries table used for Player Characters).

| Difference    | Effects                           |
| ------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **0 or less** | No effect, the target is unharmed |
| **1-3**       | 1 Damage                          |
| **4-8**       | 2 Damage                          |
| **9-12**      | 3 Damage                          |
| **13-15**     | 4 Damage                          |
| **16+**       | 5 Damage                          |

### Allocating damage

Damage is allocated to Scratches before Wounds. For each Damage noted a Scratch is taken by the NPC/creature when they can not take any more Scratches, Damage is allocated to Wounds. When an NPC/creature can take no more wounds they are unconscious, dead, or otherwise removed from play.

### Scratches

Scratches are used to absorb damage without any mechanical impact on the NPC or creature. Think of this as luck, minor wounds or not having enough impact on a creature to substantively slow it down.

### Effects of taking wounds

Some NPCs/creatures are immediately removed as soon as they take a Wound, others have Wound Thresholds. When a Threshold is reached the NPC is at -1D for all actions until heal. Some creatures or threats might have multiple Wound Thresholds, each one reached, resulting in another 1D being removed.

## Example of NPC damage

The following is an example of how NPC damage and wounds

*Jon's Heldaw is amid combat with angry villager and his crazed cultist ally. The villager is a regular human, so has 2 Scratches and 1 Wound. The cultist however is driven by the power of his dark god (and more than a few drugs) with 4 Scratches and 2 Wounds. He also has a Wound Threshold of 1.*

*Early in the fight Jon hits the villager with his Axe and rolls a difference of 8 his Injury roll. Looking at NPC Damage Table this results in 2 Damage, which is absorbed by the villages Scratches (resulting in no real effect outside of the narrative one of the villager leaping backwards at the last second as Jon's blade splits open his jerkin). The next round Jon hits again and only rolls a difference of 3. This however is 1 Damage, enough to do the single wound to the villager and take him out of the fight (The Game Master narrating a wrist being lopped off, and the screaming man collapsing to the ground grasping at the stump).*

*Later in the fight, facing the more dangerous cultist, Jon again hits, and - with a couple of exploding Wild Die 6s - roll 18 above the crazy's Toughness. This however only does 5 Damage, and the cultist Scratches absorb the first 4. As he also has two Wounds the single remaining damage doesn't take the mad man out. However, as he does have a Wound Threshold at 1, the cultist will be at -1D for the result of the fight.*

*The Game Master describes the scene with the two combatants swirling past each other in a flurry of limbs and metal, with Jon's blade solidly connecting with the cultist's skull. The lunatic stumbles, and almost falls, but recovers at the last moment, swings around to face his attacker. Jon's character blanches as he sees the cultist's face is a bloody ruin of teeth, bone, and a loose hanging eyeâ€¦ but is unsurprised to see the "man" lick the mess from his lips and half stagger, half run back into the fray!*

# Sample Setting: Jericho

*It's been only five years since the Republic of Luna broke away from the vice-like grip of the Earth's Council of Outer Planets. Five years since a bloody uprising that saw thousands die and hundreds of thousands displaced. For those who lived through this dark and dangerous time it was upheaval like no other; almost overnight all the registered citizens of Earth were expelled from the Moon, while all those of selenic origin returned to their new nation*

*But not even a rebellion can stop the flow of commerce. Quickly, too quickly for some, Earth's corporations returned to the Moon, driven by its inviting tax policies and its proximity to the most important element now known to man - Helium-3.*

*Of course, where the corporations go so do their silent wars. From the highest towers of Cynthia through to the deepest mines of Theia, these organisations plot and plan their next power plays. But the republic is strong, and while it opens its arms to the corporations, both as a source of income and as a secure tie back to the Earth, it does not tolerate open conflict. To undertake a brazen act of "war" would immediately exclude a corporation from access to 3He, and such a deed is paramount to one signing their own death warrant.*

*So it is that the corporations battle instead through proxies, mercenaries and spies that infiltrate, hack or kill their way to the most secret of secrets. Soldiers that can be plausibly denied, and resources that can chewed up and spat out as easily as the republic extracts Helium-3.*

*You are one of these proxiesâ€¦ Just how long will you survive?*

## Themes of Jericho

Jericho is a game of espionage, heists and intrigue. In this setting the characters take on a variety of roles, from cyber criminals out to make the most of the chaos, elite Luna Security representatives desperate to protect the interests of the fledging republic or agents of the Earth corporates willing to go to any length to secure access to 3He.

In Jericho, the characters will be thrown into a world where today's enemies are tomorrow's allies and the need for profit outweighs the price of any human's life. Specific, it should include elements of:

- **Cyberpunk and Experiments**: It is a new dawn of man, and technology and science makes everything betterâ€¦ or worse. Jericho is free of oversite and responsibility, prefect or those wanting to change the world in their image.
- **Corruption and Greed**: Everyone is out for themselves, from the corporates desperate to secure the 3He, to the Republic determined to survive alone - damned be the impact n its citizens.
- **Betrayal and Bargaining**: Jericho is at war, with Earth, the corporations and itself. There are no such things as allies, just temporary bed-mates desiring the same outcomes.

## Creating characters

The characters of Jericho are elite operatives, capable of taking on missions that simple citizens of Earth or the Moon could never contemplate undertaking. They are assassins, hackers, spies and cyber warriors battling over a new technical frontier.

### Setting specific tags

In addition to general Tags, the following might be found on characters in the Jericho setting.

- **Hacker**: Accessing systems and the workings of technology are second nature to this character.
- **Bureaucrat**: The character knows the "ins and outs" of administrative machine running Jericho.
- **Fixer**: You know where to find things and how to make thing disappear.
- **Zero G Trained**: Not everyone is cut out for life in space, and there are plenty of places where gravity just doesn't exist.
- **Ex Corporate**: Terran or Republican all corporations want the same thing; it's knowing how to get them to believe you know what's in their best interests.
- **Moon born**: You were born and raised in Jericho, and know it's people and places like the back of your hand,
- **Special Forces Trained**: You were the best of the best of the best and have skills and talents that support you well in Jericho.

### Setting specific perks

The following Perks might be available for characters in the Jericho setting.

- **Synthetic**: You were born in test tube and grown in a vat. You body if full of redundant systems and all it takes is a bit of Snythflesh to repair the holes. Your wounds (including Mortal ones) heal with a **Physique** test (with Target
  Number 7) and one day's rest, although you still die with enough damage.
- **Cyber Senses**: You have the latest in hearing and sensing technology. You are never surprised and can always reroll any dice rolled when undertaking observation or erception focus tasks.
- **Weapon Interface**: You are connected to your weapon via a direct interface. Not only does this mean you gain the Tag of "Marksman" but you also gain +1D to your selected weapon's damage.
- **Jacker**: You can jack directly into most technology. This allows you to reroll any computer or hacking dice in any tasks you might make.
- **Morph Flesh**: You can make your skin change colour and shape. This ensures you can look like any person you can visualise.
- **RAM Slot**: You can load up specific programmes to ensure you are ready for anything. Each adventure you can define up to 3 Tags that represent this knowledge.
- **Dura Tough**: You have inbuilt armour providing for a natural Amour Value of 3.

### Setting specific complications

The following Complications might be appropriate for characters in the Jericho setting.

- **Countdown Clock**: For Sythentic characters only. You have been designed with a limited life span, and as such are determined to do everything you can in the time you have.
- **Idealist**: You are determined that the Republic will survive and thrive, even if everything you see around you indicates it is just a matter of time before it all collapses.
- **Earthborn** (or **Vatborn**) - You aren't from Jericho and so people don't like you. Unfortunately, for whatever reason, you stand out as not being from the Moon and this is a constant cause of trouble.
- **Outlawed**: The authorities of Jericho maintain a length blacklist of those they see is undesirableand you are one of them. Of course, just because the Representation don't want you, doesn't mean you aren't useful.

## About Jericho

Jericho, a city of light in the darkness of space, is located across numerous craters in the South pole of the Moon. Built into the edges of these features, and enclosed with numerous domes and environmental protection systems, the city looks - to those landing at its various spaceports - like great colourful bubbles rising from the Moon's surface. The crater rims themselves protect the settlements, while also providing excellent locations to house the massive field of solar panels needed to power the republic.

Much of Jericho is located underground, connected by vast tunnels and cave complexes, which in turn create somewhat of a natural segregation of the vast "neighbourhoods" of the republic. Cynthia is centred around Shackleton's crater and is the hub of the Representation (the governing body of Jericho). It houses the various corporate headquarters and enough comforts to make one almost believe they were back on Earth. Selene, located within the de Gerlache crater, is connected via various roads, tunnels and complex to Cynthia and it is here where much of the real business of the moon takes place. A multitude of semi-autonomous communities buried in its walls many with their own private labs, research facilities and launchpads. It is at Theia, the name given
to deepest parts of the Sverdrup crater that the rich abundance of Helium 3 is found and mined. The corporations and companies with rights to this precious resource defend their claims with their lives. Life in Theia is dangerous but offers those willing to work there access to untold riches.

## Non-player characters

There are a vast number of difference types of Non-Player characters, operatives on ericho might encounter, including:

### Cyber-mastiff

These robotic dogs are often used to protect sensible sites or private homes. They have unequalled senses and a vicious bite.

### Street thug/corporate guard

The run of the mill corp guard, street soldier or soldier found almost every corner or building in Jericho.

### Synth assassin

The best killers are created not trained, and Synthetics assassins are built to be silent, deadly and almost unstoppable.

## Adventure seeds

The following adventure ideas couple used in the Jericho setting.

- **The Package**: The characters are directed to locate and protect a package. Unfortunately their employers are the only ones who want it.
- **Lab 220**: Located outside of the Jericho craters many legal and not so legal labs and habitats exist. Lab 220 is causing trouble for the republic.
- **Mr Holmes**: Holmes is a corporate who looks and acts a bit too much like an ex-Terran official who is wanted â€¦ well by everyone. The characters need to locate their target and ensure they have the right man.

## Why Raw Six Exists

Raw Six began as I looked for a system to use for a one-off session of the Summerland RPG late in 2020.I needed something that was easily to teach but could also be adapted on the fly. These requirements soon extended as I found myself booking in to run a few games a local roleplaying convention to run a few games. The Open D6 mechanics seemed a logical option to these challenges, and as it is likely obvious, I've long been a fan of the Mini Six interpretation.

However, while the Open D6 (and its various family members) come with incredibility light touch mechanics, I have always struggled with balancing a Task driven game that also allows the totals of its dice rolls to vary so wildly. To explain, in Open D6 character dice pools (Attributes and Skills) can range anything from a single D6 through to 6 or more. This makes it hard to determine a fair target number when one player might have only 2 dice to roll (resulting in a number from 2 to 12) and another might have 5 (giving them results from 5 to 30!). I realise that this is a pretty minor complaint to make, but to me it was one that I could never reconcile.

Raw Six, therefore, is my attempt to "fix this problem".

As this document lays out, my solution is threefold;
a) limit the dice range being rolled
b) remove the need for specific skills
c) ensure that the players still maintained some control over their task actions (i.e. to empower and provide options on those important rolls).
The first was easy, just reduce the number of dice the players had to distribute in character creation. The second was two get rid of "traditional" skills, and instead provide ways that you could reflect the characters unique abilities, knowledge and talents in the game. This is where Tags come in, an open way of describing the above but ensuring that they provide a bonus that doesn't push the number of dice rolled out too far. Finally, I needed a way to provide the players with some in-game currency to allow them to have an advantage over non-player characters and opponents (although I was aware that it couldn't be unlimited resource, otherwise we'd be back at square one). This is where Stress dice (representing willpower, concentration, and determination) comes in, a pool that a player can spend to increase their chances of success. Stress is a balancing mechanic that allows the characters to be heroic but comes with risk and consequence if pushed too far (as a note I have some future ideas to make Stress a bit more interesting than just a pool of numbers).

With that all said, I'll leave it to you to decide whether Iwas successful of notâ€¦.

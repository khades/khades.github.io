~~Ultimate Doom~~ | 1 | 1 | 2.5/5 | Good wad with proper structure due to episodes.
~~Doom 2~~ | 1 |1 | 2.5/5 | Uneven quality.
~~Sigil~~ | - | 1.5 |3.5/5| NICE, great small levels, outstanding architecture and visuals.
~~TNT: Evilution~~ | 2 | 1.5 | 0/5 | Bad encounters, maps are too large and uneven conventions (buttons etc). Some glimpse of fun, but overall not worth playing.
~~Memento Mori I~~ | 2 | 1.5 | 3/5 | Some problems with linedefs but progression and encounters are AWESOME, proper build-up from small maps to BIG maps, big and nice packed maps.
~~Requiem~~ |2| 2 |0.5/5| Gimmicky map design that doesnt work that good a lot of times. Harder due to ammo management, really uneven on map difficulty and sizes, does not feel coherent. More like a swan song. Does not worth playing.
~~Memento Mori II~~|2| 2 |3/5| Almost same as MM1, but slightly more harder and slighly less ammo, map12 is VERY sigil-like.
~~Plutonia~~ | 3| 2.5 |2.5/5| Nice small maps with tight encounters, tad worse than MM in design, no ammo starvation tho. WTF was map28 and map29 tho.
~~Scythe~~ | 3| 3.5 |3/5| Nice ultrasmall maps, difficulty ramp is nice, last third is dickish. Map30 is just like most of hell revealed, which not like all other maps of WAD. Dunno, i like map size of that.
~~Hell Revealed~~  |3| 5 |0/5| Classic-like maps. At map13 already hard af. Map18 is outright bad. Feel like cheating using mouse aim. Map24 and Map25 are insane. Almost dropped it off, dragged to long, longer than plutonia+scythe. Does not worth playing. Whoever put that in tier 3 is WRONG.
~~Eviternity~~ | - | 3.5 | 4/5 | Exceptional map design and assets. Ammo management. With sector lightning like that you dont need dynamic lightning. Map32 has great Metroidvania feel, meanwhile Map19 is linear and not done good enough with linedefs.
~~Ancient Aliens~~ | - | 3.5 | 5/5 | If you start to play defencivly - you die and it is hard, if you move - it is simplier. Insane graphics and architecture.
~~Valiant~~|4 | 4 |3.5/5| Nothing that outstanding visually compared to eviternity or ancient aliens (well map31 is like AA), but same complexity of architecture. Feels good due to custom weapons\enemies. Sadly not episodes are equally good.
~~Kama Sutra~~ |4 | 4 |4/5| Its like Requiem with difficulty of Hell Revealed, but done right and fun. Start to become hard on map13. Starts to be REAL hard at map 23, and sadly loses some of polish. Worth playing. Classic design.
~~Speed of Doom~~|4| 5 | 4/5 | Well i kinda get the idea of more modern map design, cause there's stark difference between SOD and kama sutra in textures and overall layout, but NOT in encounters. SOD is like just more polished Kama Sutra. It gets to level of Hell Revealed hardness, but difficulty ramp is GREAT. Even tho i have hard times with some maps (like map27 that gets too stressful for me), there's satisfaction of finishing level, that thing that was absent in most hard Hell Revealed maps.

Name | Announced Difficulty | Actual Difficulty | Rating | review
-- | -- | -- | -- | --
~~ultimate doom~~ | 1 | 1 | 3.5/5 | Good wad with proper structure due to episodes.
~~doom 2~~ | 1 |1 | 3/5 | 
~~sigil~~ | - | 1.5 |4.5/5| NICE, great small levels, outstanding architecture and visuals.
~~evilution~~ | 2 | 1.5 | 1.5/5 | Bad encounters, maps are too large and uneven conventions (buttons etc).
~~memento mori I~~ | 2 | 1.5 | 4.5/5 | Some problems with linedefs but progression and encounters are AWESOME, proper build-up from small maps to BIG maps, big and nice packed maps
~~requiem~~ |2| 2 |2.5/5| Gimmicky map design that doesnt work that good a lot of times. Harder due to ammo management, really uneven on map difficulty and sizes, does not feel coherent, still better than TNT.
~~memento mori II~~|2| 2 |4.5/5| Almost same as MM1, but slightly more harder and slighly less ammo, map12 is VERY sigil-like.
~~plutonia~~ | 3| 2.5 |4/5| Nice small maps with tight encounters, tad worse than MM in design, no ammo starvation tho. WTF was map28 and map29 tho.
~~scythe~~ | 3| 3.5 |4.5/5| Nice smallest maps, difficulty ramp is nice, last third is dickish. Map30 is just like most of hell revealed, which not like all other maps of WAD.
~~hell revealed~~  |3| 4 |3.5/5| Nice classic-like maps. At map13 already hard af. Map18 is outright bad.  Feel like cheating using mouse aim. Map24 and Map25 are insane. Almost dropped it off, dragged to long, longer than plutonia+scythe.
~~Eviternity~~ | - | 3.5 | 5/5 | Exceptional map design and assets. Ammo management. With sector lightning like that you dont need dynamic lightning. Map32 has great Metroidvania feel, meanwhile Map19 is linear and not done good enough with linedefs.
ancient aliens | - | 3.5 | 4/5 | If you start to play defencivly - you die and it is hard, if you move - it is simplier. Nice graphics.

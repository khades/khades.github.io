~~Ultimate Doom~~ | 1 | 1 | 3/5 | Good wad with proper structure due to episodes.
~~Doom 2~~ | 1 |1 | 3/5 | Uneven quality. Will treat it 2.5/5 as baseline for rating
~~Sigil~~ | - | 1.5 |3/5| NICE, great small levels, outstanding architecture and visuals.
~~TNT: Evilution~~ | 2 | 1.5 | 1/5 | Bad encounters, maps are too large and uneven conventions (buttons etc). Some glimpse of fun, but overall not worth playing.
~~Memento Mori I~~ | 2 | 1.5 | 2.5/5 | Some problems with linedefs but progression and encounters are AWESOME, proper build-up from small maps to BIG maps, big and nice packed maps.
~~Requiem~~ |2| 2 |1.5/5| Gimmicky map design that doesnt work that good a lot of times. Harder due to ammo management, really uneven on map difficulty and sizes, does not feel coherent. More like a swan song. Does not worth playing.
~~Memento Mori II~~|2| 2 |2.5/5| Almost same as MM1, but slightly more harder and slighly less ammo, map12 is VERY sigil-like.
~~Plutonia~~ | 3| 2.5 |4/5| Nice small maps with tight encounters, tad worse than MM in design, no ammo starvation tho. WTF was map28 and map29 tho.
~~Scythe~~ | 3| 3.5 |3.5/5| Nice ultrasmall maps, difficulty ramp is nice, last third is dickish. Map30 is just like most of hell revealed, which not like all other maps of WAD. Dunno, i like map size of that.
~~Hell Revealed~~  |3| 5 |0/5| Classic-like maps. At map13 already hard af. Map18 is outright bad. Feel like cheating using mouse aim. Map24 and Map25 are insane. Almost dropped it off, dragged to long, longer than plutonia+scythe. Does not worth playing. Whoever put that in tier 3 is WRONG.
~~Eviternity~~ | - | 3.5 | 4.5/5 | Exceptional map design and assets. Ammo management. With sector lightning like that you dont need dynamic lightning. Map32 has great Metroidvania feel, meanwhile Map19 is linear and not done good enough with linedefs.
~~Ancient Aliens~~ | - | 3.5 | 5/5 | If you start to play defencivly - you die and it is hard, if you move - it is simplier. Insane graphics and architecture.
~~Valiant~~|4 | 4 |3/5| Nothing that outstanding visually compared to eviternity or ancient aliens (well map31 is like AA), but same complexity of architecture. Feels good due to custom weapons\enemies. Sadly not episodes are equally good.
~~Kama Sutra~~ |4 | 4 |4/5| Its like Requiem with difficulty of Hell Revealed, but done right and fun. Start to become hard on map13. Starts to be REAL hard at map 23, and sadly loses some of polish. Worth playing. Pretty obvious of design shifting from classic to modern.
~~Speed of Doom~~|4| 5 | 4.5/5 | Well i kinda get the idea of more modern map design, cause there's stark difference between SOD and kama sutra in textures and overall layout, but NOT in encounters. SOD is like just more polished Kama Sutra. It gets to level of Hell Revealed hardness, but difficulty ramp is GREAT. Even tho i have hard times with some maps (like map27 that gets too stressful for me), there's satisfaction of finishing level, that thing that was absent in most hard Hell Revealed maps.
~~Alien Vendetta~~ |4 | 4.5 | 3/5 | Should've played it right before Kama sutra?  Classic design, quite obvious it was created when doom was played on 320x200 resolution. Less details than KS, but more solid setting. Encounters are not as good as in Kama Sutra or Speed of Doom. From level 20 it gets kinda boring and non-rewarding (unlike speed of doom and kama sutra).
~~Resurgence~~|5 | 6 | 4/5 | Started to watch Dean Of Doom at later parts of Speed of Doom and AV. At that time i feel that i overly burned out playing doom. I shortened the list itself to having just Scythe II and Sunlust. The wad itself? GOOOD. Overall design of starting parts are like "You'll die several times exporting starting areas to find places to hide or pickup or save yourself". At the same time some maps are designed in wastly different ways, so combat flows differenty a lot of times. I'd say that Kama sutra was somewhat stingy on overall graphical design, but SOD and Resurge are that level of GOOD that i cant even call it "RETRO AESTHETICS", it is just good. Countrary to Dean of Doom i find it being harder than SOD. It goes HAAAAAAAAARD as fuck at last 10 levels, so i have to increase difficulty level in table. Took me two years to finish them.
~~Scythe II~~| 5| 6| 4.5/5 | I see why it is liked so much. Overall difficulty progression is not as even as in SoD, just hardstops at level 23 like "fuck you, now we are slaughters maps". Design and arhitectyre is great. Screw map31, just screw it. Last episode is brutal, but i'd say that it is sliiighly easier than Resurge. It is way too more memorable and i get the praise, but given there's better maps nowadays i can't assign 5/5 for it

TNT Wads | - | 
~~No Rest For Living~~ | - | 1.5 | 3.5/5 | Tad better than doom 2
~~Lunatic~~ | - | 1.5 | 3/5 | Tad worse than Valiant, but same themes of lunar surface, still great. Really easy.
~~Vanguard~~| -- | 2.5 | 4/5 | i like it better than Valiant, smaller maps. While somewhat dense with monsters, smaller maps have better "progression" overall, especially when i play without any challenge of doing everything 100%. Maps look "slaugthery", but encounters are skippable. A pleasure to play for that small package. It is fun to restart play doom after half-year break with that WAD. 
~~Sawdust~~ | -- | 4 | 3/5 | Uneven difficulty, overall it is Valiant, i kinda see why it didnt fit in Valiant.
Plutonia 2| 4 | -- | -- | Want to play it, since a lot of maps done by one of the Kama Sutra author
~~Doom the way ID did~~  | -- | 1.5 | 4/5 | Good, Just right, not overly ambitious, just classic design.  I used voxels, brightmaps and Woof, great time. I am amazed how different maps can be in Doom. 
~~Ultimate Doom the way ID did~~ | -- | 2.5 | 2.5/5 | Stars good, last maps are genuinly difficult. Last map is genuinly bad in my opinion,  just cryptic labyrinth with obscure puzzles and unclear goals.
2002 A Doom Oddysey | -- | 1.5 | 3/5 | Tad blander than Doom the way ID did, somewhat outdated encounter, like e2m7 corridor with many singular imps - just outdated. Author prolly thought that shotgunners are so fun to fight against so he put loads of them, but they are not fun in that volume and predictiability

~~Going Down~~| -- | 4 | 4/5 | goooood ^_______^. Music is insanely questionable yeh, but a lot of charm with small maps and almost-slaughter maps. I mean maps 26-28 big in quanitity of enemies but far far simplier than map30 of resurgence or similar wads.
